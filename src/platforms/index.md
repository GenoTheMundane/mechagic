##  Main Accounts <i class="ph ph-suitcase"></i>

Exactly what it says on the tin
As you can see there aren't a whole lotta websites that I'm active on
You could say that I am active on reddit but you probably know that website has been going downhill a bit

Besides if Tumblr goes down then this will probably be the only site I'm available on, asides from lemmy and discord (might join matrix in the future, who knows)

My Discord account is "mechagic"
